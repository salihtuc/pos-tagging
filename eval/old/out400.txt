Pierre Vinken , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .
Rudolph Agnew , 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , was named *-1 a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate .
A form of asbestos once used * * to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed * to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported 0 *T*-1 .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that *T*-1 show up decades later , researchers said 0 *T*-2 .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that *T*-2 makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although preliminary findings were reported *-2 more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely * to bring new attention to the problem .
A Lorillard spokewoman said , " This is an old story .
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
There is no asbestos in our products now . "
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who *T*-3 studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
" We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , " said *T*-1 James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said 0 asbestos was used *-1 in " very modest amounts " in * making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced *-1 with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold *-3 , the company said 0 *T*-1 .
Among 33 men who *T*-4 worked closely with the substance , 28 *ICH*-1 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than * expected *?* , the researchers said 0 *T*-1 .
" The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who *T*-5 study asbestos-related diseases , " said *T*-1 Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears *-1 to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied * in Western industrialized countries , he said 0 *T*-2 .
The plant , which *T*-1 is owned *-4 by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract *ICH*-2 with Lorillard * to make the cigarette filters .
The finding probably will support those who *T*-6 argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found * in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said 0 *T*-1 .
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that *T*-7 does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that *T*-1 are classified *-5 as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected *-1 by the body , Dr. Mossman explained 0 *T*-2 .
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed *-6 .
About 160 workers at a factory that *T*-8 made paper for the Kent filters were exposed *-7 to asbestos in the 1950s .
Areas of the factory *ICH*-2 were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used *-8 *T*-1 .
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used * * to make filters .
Workers described " clouds of blue dust " that *T*-1 hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
" There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , " said *T*-1 Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
" But you have *-1 to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
It has no bearing on our work force today .
Yields on money-market mutual funds continued *-1 to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked * by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are thought *-1 to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered *-9 a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some * to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , said *T*-1 Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields " may blip up again before they blip down " because of recent rises in short-term interest rates .
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold * at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue *-1 to pour cash into money funds .
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion *U* during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion *U* .
Typically , money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar , the top-yielding fund , had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which *T*-9 boosts its yield .
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .
J.P. Bolduc , vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co. , which *T*-10 holds a 83.4 % interest in this energy-services company , was elected *-10 a director .
He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels , formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman , who *T*-11 resigned .
W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy 's seven board seats .
Pacific First Financial Corp. said 0 shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $ 27 *U* a share , or $ 212 million *U* .
The thrift holding company said 0 it expects *-1 to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end .
McDermott International Inc. said 0 its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p . A. for $ 295 million *U* .
Finmeccanica is an Italian state-owned holding company with interests in the mechanical engineering industry .
Bailey Controls , based * in Wickliffe , Ohio , makes computerized industrial controls systems .
It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $ 370 million *U* .
The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority * to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said 0 *T*-1 .
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion *U* from $ 2.87 trillion *U* .
Legislation 0 *T*-1 to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled *-11 in the fight over * cutting capital-gains taxes .
The House has voted *-1 to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion *U* , but the Senate is n't expected *-2 to act until next week at the earliest .
The Treasury said 0 the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .
Clark J. Vitulli was named *-12 senior vice president *RNR*-1 and general manager *RNR*-1 of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp .
In the new position he will oversee Mazda 's U.S. sales , service , parts and marketing operations .
Previously , Mr. Vitulli , 43 years old , was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. 's Chrysler division .
He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years .
When it 's time for their biannual powwow *T*-1 , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .
Not this year .
The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
And the city decided *-1 to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
The idea , of course : * to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place 0 for a company to expand *T*-1 .
On the receiving end of the message were *T*-1 officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge .
Champagne and dessert followed .
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , *-1 unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
A buffet breakfast was held *-1 in the museum , where food and drinks are banned *-2 to everyday visitors *T*-3 .
Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race .
After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
*-1 No dummies , the drivers pointed out 0 they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before *-1 boarding the buses again .
This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
*-2 Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one *T*-1 , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
More than a few CEOs say 0 the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February .
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million *U* in October , * reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released * Wednesday .
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , * casting a cloud on South Korea 's export-oriented economy .
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion *U* , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion *U* , up 20 % from last October .
South Korea 's economic boom , which *T*-12 began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
Government officials said 0 exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion *U* .
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million *U* so far this year .
From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion *U* .
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion *U* , up 19 % .
Newsweek , *-1 trying *-2 to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said 0 it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan 0 the magazine has offered advertisers *T*-1 in three years .
Plans that *T*-13 give advertisers discounts for * maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
Alan Spoon , recently named * Newsweek president , said 0 Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 *U* .
In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while *-1 not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate *ICH*-2 will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 *U* .
U.S. News has yet *-1 to announce its 1990 ad rates .
Newsweek said 0 it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which *T*-1 awards space credits *ICH*-2 to advertisers on " renewal advertising . "
The magazine will reward with " page bonuses " advertisers who in 1990 *T*-1 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 *U* in 1989 and $ 340,000 *U* in 1990 .
Mr. Spoon said 0 the plan is not an attempt * to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau .
" What *T*-14 matters is what advertisers are paying *T*-15 per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , " said *T*-1 Mr. Spoon .
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches .
However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently .
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % .
Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , *-1 flat from the same period last year .
U.S. News ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % .
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , *-1 saying that the risks were too high *RNR*-4 and the potential payoff too far in the future *RNR*-4 * to justify a higher offer .
The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which *T*-1 also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company *T*-2 .
New England Electric , based * in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion *U* *ICH*-1 *-4 to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion *U* value 0 United Illuminating places *T*-2 on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion *U* 0 Northeast says 0 its bid is worth *T*-3 .
United Illuminating is based *-13 in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based *-14 in Hartford , Conn .
PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion *U* .
John Rowe , president *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of New England Electric , said 0 the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related * to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
" When we evaluated *-2 raising our bid *T*-1 , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
That got hard 0 * to take *T*-1 , " he added *T*-2 .
Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric .
No matter who *T*-16 owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said 0 *T*-1 .
" That attracts attention ...
it was just another one of the risk factors " that *T*-17 led to the company 's decision * to withdraw from the bidding , he added 0 *T*-1 .
Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders , said 0 the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process .
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % *U* over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed * by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted 0 *T*-1 .
" Now the field is less cluttered , " he added *T*-1 .
Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire .
Northeast said 0 it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved * by the bankruptcy court .
PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 *U* , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Norman Ricken , 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys " R " Us Inc. , and Frederick Deane Jr. , 63 , chairman of Signet Banking Corp. , were elected *-15 directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain .
They succeed Daniel M. Rexinger , retired Circuit City executive vice president , and Robert R. Glauber , U.S. Treasury undersecretary , on the 12-member board .
Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered *-1 *-2 to refund about $ 250 million *U* to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected * for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant .
The refund was about $ 55 million *U* more than * previously ordered *-1 by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said 0 it may be the largest ever required * of a state or local utility .
State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison *-1 to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 *U* each to Edison customers who *T*-18 have received electric service since April 1986 , including about two million customers who *T*-19 have moved during that period .
Judge Curry ordered the refunds *-1 to begin Feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts * to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .
" The refund pool ... may not be held *-1 hostage through another round of appeals , " Judge Curry said *T*-2 .
Commonwealth Edison said 0 it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering *-1 appealing Judge Curry 's order .
The exact amount of the refund will be determined *-16 next year based on actual collections made * until Dec. 31 of this year .
Commonwealth Edison said 0 the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 *U* a share .
For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million *U* , or $ 3.01 *U* a share .
A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that * tracking down the two million customers whose addresses *T*-20 have changed during the past 3 1\/2 years would be " an administrative nightmare . "
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Commonwealth Edison closed at $ 38.375 *U* , down 12.5 cents .
The $ 2.5 billion *U* Byron 1 plant near Rockford , Ill. , was completed *-17 in 1985 .
In a disputed 1985 ruling , the Commerce Commission said 0 Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million *U* *-1 to pay for the plant .
But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal .
The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission *-1 to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .
The utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986 .
In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million *U* of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded *-1 , plus interest .
In his ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million *U* to the commission 's calculations .
Last month , Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9 % .
Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer\/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated *T*-1 at $ 140 million *U* .
And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry 's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison 's Braidwood 2 plant .
Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $ 245 million *U* in rate increases 0 *T*-1 to pay for Braidwood 2 .
The commission is expected *-1 to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end .
Last year Commonwealth Edison had *-1 to refund $ 72.7 million *U* for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant .
Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said 0 *T*-1 .
The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .
The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March .
October sales , compared * with the previous month , inched down 0.4 % .
Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units .
Sales of medium-sized cars , which *T*-21 benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 .
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. , a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , said 0 it opened a plant *ICH*-3 in South Korea 0 *T*-2 to manufacture control devices .
The new plant , located * in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul , will help *-2 meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said 0 *T*-1 .
The plant will produce control devices used * in motor vehicles and household appliances .
The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears *-1 to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray .
Not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied *-1 directly to Mr. Cray , so is *T*-2 its balance sheet .
Documents filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million *U* in financing 0 it is providing the new firm *T*-1 if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project 0 he heads *T*-2 is scrapped *-18 .
The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype .
Moreover , there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far , though the company says 0 it is talking with several prospects .
While many of the risks were anticipated *-19 when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May *T*-1 , the strings 0 it attached *T*-2 to the financing had n't been made *-3 public until yesterday .
" We did n't have much of a choice , " Cray Computer 's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said *T*-1 in an interview .
" The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and without him it could not be completed *-20 .
Cray Research did not want *-1 to fund a project that *T*-22 did not include Seymour . "
The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates *-1 needing perhaps another $ 120 million *U* in financing beginning next September .
But Mr. Barnum called that " a worst-case " scenario .
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 *U* yesterday *-1 to close at $ 38 *U* in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research 's decision * to link its $ 98.3 million *U* promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company .
" It has *-2 to be considered *-21 as an additional risk for the investor , " said *T*-1 Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis .
" Cray Computer will be a concept stock , " he said *T*-1 .
" You either believe 0 Seymour can do it again or you do n't *?* . "
Besides the designer 's age , other risk factors for Mr. Cray 's new company include the Cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology .
The SEC documents describe those chips , which *T*-1 are made *-22 of gallium arsenide , as *-2 being so fragile and minute 0 they will require special robotic handling equipment .
In addition , the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer .
Cray Computer also will face intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which *T*-23 has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which *T*-24 is expected *-1 to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 .
The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd .
The new company said 0 it believes 0 there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced * between $ 15 million and $ 30 million *U* -- presumably the Cray-3 price range .
Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are *-1 to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares 0 they own *T*-2 in a distribution expected * to occur in about two weeks .
No price for the new shares has been set *-23 .
Instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace * to decide .
Cray Computer has applied *-1 to trade on Nasdaq .
Analysts calculate Cray Computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 *U* a share .
Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million *U* in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which *T*-25 has been a drain on Cray Research 's earnings .
Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff *T*-1 .
Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able *-2 to report a profit of $ 19.3 million *U* *ICH*-3 for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million *U* 0 it posted *T*-1 .
On the other hand , had it existed then , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million *U* loss .
Mr. Cray , who *T*-1 could n't be reached *-24 for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo. , company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement 0 he had *T*-2 with Cray Research .
*-25 Regarded *-1 as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid *-25 $ 600,000 *U* at Cray Research last year .
At Cray Computer , he will be paid *-26 $ 240,000 *U* .
Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware .
All came from Cray Research .
Cray Computer , which *T*-26 currently employs 241 people , said 0 it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 .
John R. Stevens , 49 years old , was named *-27 senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions .
He will continue *-1 to report to Donald Pardus , president and chief executive officer .
Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company .
Arthur A. Hatch , 59 , was named *-28 executive vice president of the company .
He was previously president of the company 's Eastern Edison Co. unit .
John D. Carney , 45 , was named *-1 to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison .
Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison .
Robert P. Tassinari , 63 , was named *-29 senior vice president of Eastern Utilities .
He was previously vice president .
The U.S. , *-1 claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries 0 it is closely watching *T*-2 for * allegedly failing *-3 to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights .
However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced 0 *T*-1 .
Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .
Mrs. Hills said 0 many of the 25 countries that she placed *T*-1 under varying degrees of scrutiny have made " genuine progress " on this touchy issue .
She said 0 there is " growing realization *ICH*-1 " around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the " creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . "
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by *-1 discouraging their own scientists and authors and by *-1 deterring U.S. high-technology firms from *-2 investing or marketing their best products there .
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for *-1 creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained * to pursue movie and book pirates .
Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures 0 * to aid these teams *T*-2 , she said 0 *T*-1 .
Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by *-2 initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation 0 * to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films *T*-1 .
That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for * showing their films .
Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed *-2 to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and *-2 to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said 0 *T*-1 .
These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though .
They will remain on a lower-priority list that *T*-27 includes 17 other countries .
Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed *-1 to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the " priority " list .
Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases , said 0 the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined * with a growing recognition that * protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made * by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
" What this tells us *T*-28 is that U.S. trade law is working , " he said *T*-1 .
He said 0 Mexico could be one of the next countries 0 *T*-1 to be removed *-2 from the priority list because of its efforts * to craft a new patent law .
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about " disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . "
She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey .
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
So far , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough *-1 to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act .
Argentina said 0 it will ask creditor banks *-1 to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion *U* -- the third-highest in the developing world .
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed *-1 to be the first time 0 such an action has been called for *-3 by an Argentine official of such stature *T*-2 .
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year .
" Argentina aspires *-2 to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt , " Mr. Rapanelli said *T*-1 through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde .
Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford .
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week *-1 to meet with banks .
Mr. Rapanelli recently has said 0 the government of President Carlos Menem , who *T*-29 took office July 8 , feels 0 a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way 0 the debt problem may be solved *-31 *T*-1 .
But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven *-2 .

THREE COMPUTERS THAT *T*-31 CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched *-32 in 1977 .
That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market .
The computers were crude by today 's standards .
Apple II owners , for example , had *-1 to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes .
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which *T*-1 was built *-33 in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club .
In addition , the Apple II was an affordable $ 1,298 *U* .
*-1 Crude as they were *?* , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office .
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years .
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories .
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
There were many pioneer PC contributors .
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 .
Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that *T*-32 developed the disk drives for PCs .
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that *T*-33 allow PCs to share data via the telephone .
IBM , the world leader in computers , did n't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market .
Today , PC shipments annually total some $ 38.3 billion *U* world-wide .
F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said 0 its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million *U* .
Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that *T*-34 sells products under the Purepac label .
Faulding said 0 it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement * to acquire an additional 19 % .
That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right * to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock .
Oil production from Australia 's Bass Strait fields will be raised *-34 by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled * to be brought *-35 into production before the end of 1990 .
Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture .
Esso said 0 the Whiting field started production Tuesday .
Output will be gradually increased *-1 until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day .
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels .
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .
The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected *-3 to start *-1 producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year .
Esso said 0 the fields were developed *-36 after the Australian government decided in 1987 *-2 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax .
R.P. Scherer Corp. said 0 it completed the $ 10.2 million *U* sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led * by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers .
Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led * by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year , the maker of gelatin capsules decided *-1 to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses .
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program .
The White House said 0 President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that *T*-35 are n't produced *-1 in " significant quantities " in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .
The action came in response to a petition filed * by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .
Previously , watch imports were denied *-37 such duty-free treatment .
Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered * by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .
The White House said 0 Mr. Bush decided *-1 to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches " because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located * in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . "
Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled * in the Philippines and other developing nations covered * by the U.S. tariff preferences .
U.S. trade officials said 0 the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
Imports of the types of watches that *T*-36 now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million *U* *ICH*-1 in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion *U* in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and its chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in *-1 to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said 0 *T*-2 .
Mr. Stronach will direct an effort * to reduce overhead and curb capital spending " until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained *-1 , " Magna said 0 *T*-2 .
Stephen Akerfeldt , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. McAlpine .
An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .
The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth .
Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 13.73 *U* -RRB- .
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday , Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625 *U* .
Mr. Stronach , founder and controlling shareholder of Magna , resigned as chief executive officer last year *-1 to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in Canada 's Parliament .
Analysts said 0 Mr. Stronach wants *-1 to resume a more influential role in * running the company .
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization .
The company said 0 Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , *-1 assisted *-2 by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive .
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached *-38 for comment .
Magna said 0 Mr. McAlpine resigned *-1 to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients .
Lord Chilver , 63-year-old chairman of English China Clays PLC , was named *-39 a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company .
Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million *U* , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said 0 *T*-1 .
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said 0 *T*-1 at a news conference .
He said 0 more than 90 % of the funds were placed *-40 with Japanese institutional investors .
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million *U* mortgage-backed securities mutual fund .
That fund was put *-41 together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank .
The latest two funds were assembled *-42 jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co .
The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked * to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
First , they are designed *-1 to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired *-43 early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , *-1 reducing the administrative burden on investors .
By * addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said 0 *T*-1 , the new funds have become " extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . "
Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion *U* in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt , *-2 buying $ 2.4 billion *U* in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued * .
James L. Pate , 54-year-old executive vice president , was named *-44 a director of this oil concern , * expanding the board to 14 members .
LTV Corp. said 0 a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed *-1 to extend until March 8 , 1990 , the period in which the steel , aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right * to file a reorganization plan *T*-2 .
The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , * giving it court protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it attempts *-1 to work out a plan * to pay its debts .
Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A. , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $ 37-a-share *U* tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated * in the Netherlands .
The offer , advertised * in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled *-1 to expire at the end of November .
Montedison currently owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding .
The offer is being launched *-45 pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies .
Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion *U* in October to $ 84.29 billion *U* , the Finance Ministry said 0 *T*-2 .
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level *T*-1 .
The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion *U* decline in the country 's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion *U* .
* Pick a country , any country .
It 's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of new closed-end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that *T*-37 invest in stocks of a single foreign country .
No fewer than 24 country funds *ICH*-1 have been launched *-2 or registered *-2 with regulators this year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington-based research firm .
The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal .
Next week , the Philippine Fund 's launch will be capped *-46 by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time 0 a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here *T*-1 .
The next province ?
" Anything 's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund ? " quips *T*-1 George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass .
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the " closed-end fund mania " of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says 0 *T*-2 , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular *T*-1 .
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash .
Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds , most of these one-country portfolios are the " closed-end " type , *-1 issuing a fixed number of shares that *T*-38 trade publicly .
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that *T*-39 are *RNR*-1 or soon will be *RNR*-1 listed *-2 in New York or London .
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets .
" People are looking *-1 to stake their claims " now before the number of available nations runs out , says *T*-2 Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , New York .
Behind all the hoopla is *T*-1 some heavy-duty competition .
As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled *-1 to find new products that brokers find *T*-40 easy 0 * to sell *T*-2 .
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide *-1 to do it .
Financial planners often urge investors *-1 to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan .
Country funds offer an easy way 0 * to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of * seeking out individual companies *T*-1 .
But it does n't take much * to get burned *-1 .
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
Another concern : The funds ' share prices tend *-1 to swing more than the broader market .
When the stock market dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 *T*-1 , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % .
And most country funds were clobbered *-47 more than most stocks after the 1987 crash .
What *ICH*-1 *T*-41 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
After *-1 trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % .
The reason : Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks 0 they hold *T*-1 .
It 's probably worth * paying a premium for funds that *T*-42 invest in markets that *T*-43 are partially closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , some specialists say 0 *T*-1 .
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
It has been targeted *-48 by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied * to 1992 's European economic integration .
And several new funds that *T*-44 are n't even fully invested yet have jumped *-1 to trade at big premiums .
" I 'm very alarmed *-2 to see these rich valuations , " says *T*-1 Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter .
The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests 0 *T*-1 .
Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to * paying higher prices for country funds .
" There may be an international viewpoint cast *-2 on the funds listed * here , " Mr. Porter says *T*-1 .
Nonetheless , plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds .
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded * in the U.S. .
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without *-1 paying the premium .
For people who *T*-45 insist on *-5 jumping in now *-1 to buy the funds , Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : " The only advice 0 I have *T*-2 for these folks is that those who *T*-3 come to the party late had better *-4 be ready *-4 to leave quickly .
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million *U* in pre-Communist Russian debts owed * to the U.S. government , the State Department said 0 *T*-2 .
If the debts are repaid *-49 , it could clear the way 0 for Soviet bonds to be sold *-50 in the U.S. *T*-1 .
However , after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that it *EXP*-1 's " too early * to say " whether that will happen .
Coincident with the talks , the State Department said 0 it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch .
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved *-1 last spring and opened in July .
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled *-51 unless Moscow found a way 0 * to settle the $ 188 million *U* debt , which *T*-1 was lent *-52 to the country 's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 *T*-2 .
Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as * amended *-1 , it *EXP*-2 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to * satisfying the Johnson Act .
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to * raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program .
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed *-1 to rise in September .
Meanwhile , the National Association of Purchasing Management said 0 its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month .
Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .
Any reading below 50 % suggests 0 the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline .
Factories booked $ 236.74 billion *U* in orders *ICH*-1 in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion *U* in August , the Commerce Department said 0 *T*-2 .
If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % .
In a separate report , the department said 0 construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion *U* , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion *U* reported * for August .
Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
The figures in both reports were adjusted *-1 * to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said 0 demand for exports of factory goods is beginning *-1 to taper off .
At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed *-1 to revive the residential construction industry .
" What sector is *T*-46 stepping forward *-2 to pick up the slack ? " he asked *T*-1 .
" I draw a blank . "
By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all .
Factory payrolls fell in September .
So did *?* *T*-1 the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial-production index .
Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about *-1 to slip into recession .
They cite a lack of " imbalances " that *T*-47 provide early warning signals of a downturn .
Inventories are closely watched *-1 for such clues , for instance .
Economists say 0 a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that *T*-48 can lead to a recession .
But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said 0 factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 .
" This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , " said *T*-1 Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
" I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . "
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that *T*-49 eases inflation without *-1 leading to a recession .
The department said 0 orders for nondurable goods -- those intended * to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion *U* after *-1 climbing 0.9 % the month before .
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion *U* after *-1 rising 3.9 % the month before .
The department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1 % in September .
Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion *U* after * rising 5.4 % in August .
Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted 0 *T*-1 .
Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion *U* , *-3 helped *-2 by strength in the defense capital goods sector .
Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % .
In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said 0 residential construction , which *T*-50 accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % *ICH*-3 in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion *U* .
David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted 0 the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early next year .
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion *U* with no sector showing strength .
Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion *U* .
After *-1 adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said 0 construction spending did n't change in September .
For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year 's level .
The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued * earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group .
Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded * in September .
The goverment counts money as it is spent *-53 ; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded *-54 *T*-1 .
The government includes money spent * on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't *?* .
Although the purchasing managers ' index continues *-1 to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said 0 *T*-2 Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn .
He said 0 the index would have *-1 to be in the low 40 % range for several months *-1 to be considered *-55 a forecast of recession .
The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though *-1 still continuing , may be slowing .
Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September .
And 8 % *ICH*-1 said 0 export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before .
The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said 0 prices for the goods 0 they purchased *T*-1 fell .
The decline was even steeper than in September .
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly *ICH*-1 in October than they had *?* for each of the five previous months .
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle *T*-1 and delivery times lengthen *T*-1 , prices tend *-2 to rise .
The purchasing managers ' report is based *-56 on data provided * by more than 250 purchasing executives .
Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports .
It found that of the 73 % who *T*-51 import , 10 % *T*-1 said 0 they imported more in October and 12 % *T*-1 said 0 they imported less than the previous month .
While *-1 acknowledging 0 one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , " It does lead you to suspect 0 imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . "
Items listed * as *-1 being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder .
" It 's an odd thing 0 * to put *T*-1 on the list , " Mr. Bretz noted *T*-2 .
He said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk .
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled * with very low import quotas .

* Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's " A Wild Sheep Chase " -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 *U* -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common .
Although *-2 set *-1 in Japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American .
Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle " Johnny B. Goode " and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
This is Japan ?
For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in * recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore .
It *EXP*-1 's also refreshing * to read a Japanese author who *T*-52 clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing " we-Japanese " school of writers who *T*-53 perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders .
If " A Wild Sheep Chase " carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think 0 *?* .
That 's not * to say that the nutty plot of " A Wild Sheep Chase " is rooted *-57 in reality .
It 's imaginative and often funny .
A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts *T*-54 mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .
Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who *T*-55 offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who *T*-56 wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .
The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
A more recent novel , " Norwegian Wood " -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems *-1 to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 .
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who *T*-57 are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan .
Their books are written *-1 in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
In Robert Whiting 's " You Gotta Have Wa " -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 *U* -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version 0 we would be hard put *-2 to call *T*-1 a " game . "
As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a " mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . "
" Wa " is Japanese for " team spirit " and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a " humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , " as the male symbol of Japan .
But other than the fact that besuboru is played *-1 with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted *-2 -- even welcomed *-2 -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .
" You Gotta Have Wa " is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed * to two per team , fare *T*-1 in Japan .
Despite the enormous sums of money 0 they 're paid *T*-1 *-2 to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide 0 it 's not worth it and run for home .
" Funny Business " -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 *U* -RRB- by Gary Katzenstein is anything but *?* .
It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted *T*-58 for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .
In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned *-59 lunch partners *T*-1 -- and at " home " in the austere company dormitory run * by a prying caretaker *T*-2 .
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
It *EXP*-3 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of *-4 letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility .
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who *T*-59 went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring *-1 to invent another Walkman .
But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of * making an appointment * to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony .
It *EXP*-1 's a shame 0 their meeting never took place .
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it *EXP*-1 's even possible 0 Mr. Morita would have *?* too .
